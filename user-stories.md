# User Stories

## Researcher
* I want three images to display, so that users can choose their preference.
* I want to display results post-user voting, so that they can be easily read on screen. (Percentages preferred.)
* I want at least 25 votes prior to seeing results, so that I can receive ample data.
* I want the page to be appealing and easily read, so that users have a great/easy experience.

## Developer
* I want to display three images on screen that will be clickable, so that voting is quick and easy.
    * Turn assets into an array.
    * Access array of assets/images.
    * Create randomizer for displaying three images.
        * No repeats on sequential vote-screens.
        * No repeated images on same vote-screen.
* I want to cap the voting at 25, so that the researcher gets the data that was requested.
    * Create a counter and have every vote increase vote by one (25 votes required.)
* I want images to never appear twice in a row/on neighboring screens, so that the survey's integrity is preserved.

## User
* I want to be able to easily choose my preference, so that I can finish this survey quickly.
* I want to be able to see the images on screen easily, so that I don't have to spend time deciphering.
* I want to see how my favorite items stacked up against my least favorites, so that I know what to order in the future.
