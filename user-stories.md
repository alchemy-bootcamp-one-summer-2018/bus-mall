## User Stories

### *As a marketing executive, I want:*
* A simply laid-out page that presents three items and allows the focus group participants to pick the one they're most interested in.  
* I want each grouping to contain unique items, and to avoid repetition between sets as much as possible. 
* As the group member selects their preferred items, I want the app to log their votes and the amount of times each item has appeared on screen.
* After 25 groupings, I want the test to end and for the user's votes per item to appear on the screen. 

### *As a focus group participant, I want:*
* I want to be able to see the three items clearly and for them to all be roughly the same size. 
* I want my selection process to be as simple as clicking on an image. 
* I don't want to see the same items over and over again. This will make me less interested in those item over time. 
* I don't want to see items repeated in the group.
