## Researchers

1. I want the data for views and votes clearly diplayed, because it will make it easier for us to interpret and share.
1. I want the selection of products to be truly random, because any bias would have a detrimental effect on our research.
1. I want there to be clear instructions to the participant, because misunderstandings could make the results unreliable.

## Research Participants

1. I want participating to be fast because my life is busy and I'm not sure if I have time for this
1. If I see something I like, I'll want a link to somewhere I can get more information about the product.
