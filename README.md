## User Stories

* As a user, I want to click a button, so that three images will appear
* As a user, I want to be able to vote on an image and then receive three new images
* As a user, I want to go through this process a number of times, and then I want the voting to stop and to see the results
* As a marketing researcher, I want to have comparative statistics that measure the right measures, so we can prove the popularity of an item
* As a marketing researcher, I want the process to be entirely random, so that we produce the most unbiased results
* As a marketing researcher, I want the website to function without hitch, so that it is not a distraction for the user

note: user = person in the focus group (this is not a public-facing app)

## TODO

* work on grid model
* fix how I make products into components (and make products page not show views or votes, unless you set the flag)
* make the results list display more legibly
* make more and better charts
