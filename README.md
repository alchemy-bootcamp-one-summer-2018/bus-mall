## Tasks

1. Write your user stories as described above and place them in a file called `user_stories.md` in your repo. Utilize good Markdown style to make this document look nice.
1. The thing you want to build today will select three random photos from the image directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.
1. In addition, you'll want to be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image. You'll also want to track how many times each image is displayed, for statistical purposes.
1. Upon receiving a click, three new non-duplicating random images need to be automatically displayed. In other words, the three images that are displayed should contain no duplicates, nor should they duplicate with any images that we displayed immediately before.
1. After 25 selections have been made, stop listening on the images (to prevent additional voting) and also display a list of the products with votes received with each list item looking like "3 votes for the Banana Slicer showed 6 times".
