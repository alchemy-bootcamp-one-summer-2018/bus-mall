## Tasks

1. Upon receiving a click, three new non-duplicating random images need to be automatically displayed. In other words, the three images that are displayed should contain no duplicates, nor should they duplicate with any images that we displayed immediately before.
2. After 25 selections have been made, stop listening on the images (to prevent additional voting) and also display a list of the products with votes received with each list item looking like "3 votes for the Banana Slicer showed 6 times".

## In classs notes

* results are cumulative, but voting status is temporary (refreshing the page means you start at zero of 25)

## TODO

* work on displaying chart
* work on displaying products
* share data via local storage
* work on grid model
* work on header and footer
