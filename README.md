## Tasks

1. Upon receiving a click, three new non-duplicating random images need to be automatically displayed. In other words, the three images that are displayed should contain no duplicates, nor should they duplicate with any images that we displayed immediately before.

## TODO

* work on displaying products
* work on grid model
* work on header and footer
* make the results list display more legibly
* make more and better charts
