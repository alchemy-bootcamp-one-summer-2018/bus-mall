# Bus Mall Multi-Page, Local Storage and Charting

## Charting

Your savvy marketing person has just informed you that just showing users the numbered data of the click percentages 
is not going to cut it.

You need a visual representation to grab the user's attention.

### Add Charting

Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a bar chart as instructed in the initial definition of the BusMall assignment. 
If you want to try some additional chart types, do so with some of your alternate data that you have calculated 
from your vote results. The size and look of your chart is up to you, just be sure to put it in the area beneath the 
three images. Hint: for this type of data, bar charts work well. You could also play with charting to display both the 
vote count and the number of views.

> The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown. So, you'll also need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations.
